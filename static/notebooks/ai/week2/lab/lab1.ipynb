    "# Lab 1: Supervised Learning - Regression üöó\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üéØ Objective\n",
    "To build a **simple linear regression model** that predicts a car‚Äôs **fuel efficiency (Miles Per Gallon, MPG)** based on its **weight**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üìä Dataset\n",
    "We‚Äôll use the **Auto MPG dataset**, which contains technical specifications for various car models from the 1970s and 1980s.\n",
    "For simplicity, we‚Äôll load it directly from a public source.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites\n",
    "Make sure you have Python installed with the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 1: Setup and Data Loading\n",
    "First, we need to import the necessary libraries and load our data into a pandas DataFrame. This allows us to easily view and manipulate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import necessary libraries\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset from a URL\n",
    "# The dataset uses '?' for missing values, so we'll tell pandas to recognize them\n",
    "url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/mpg.csv'\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(url)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the first 5 rows to see what the data looks like\n",
    "print(\"First 5 rows of the dataset:\")\n",
    "print(df.head())\n",
    "# Get a quick summary of the data\n",
    "print(\"\\nDataset Information:\")\n",
    "df.info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "* We've loaded the data and used .head() to peek at it.\n",
    "* The .info() command shows us the columns, the number of entries, and their data types.\n",
    "* We can see 'horsepower' has some missing values and is incorrectly typed as an 'object' (text) because of the missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world data is rarely perfect. We need to handle the missing values in the 'horsepower' column. A simple strategy is to replace the missing values with the median of the column.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check for missing values\n",
    "print(\"\\nMissing values before cleaning:\")\n",
    "print(df.isnull().sum())\n",
    "\n",
    "# The 'horsepower' column has 6 missing values. Let's handle them.\n",
    "# First, calculate the median of the horsepower column\n",
    "median_hp = df['horsepower'].median()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, fill the missing values with the median\n",
    "df['horsepower'].fillna(median_hp, inplace=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Confirm that the missing values are gone\n",
    "print(\"\\nMissing values after cleaning:\")\n",
    "print(df.isnull().sum())\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "* We identified 6 missing values in 'horsepower'.\n",
    "* By filling them with the median value, we can now use this column for our analysis without errors.\n",
    "* The inplace=True argument modifies the DataFrame directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Before building a model, it's crucial to visualize the data to understand the relationships between variables. Let's plot the relationship between the car's weight and its MPG.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n",
    "plt.scatter(df['weight'], df['mpg'])\n",
    "plt.title('MPG vs. Weight of the Car')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Weight (lbs)')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Miles Per Gallon (MPG)')\n",
    "plt.grid(True)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "* The plot clearly shows a negative linear relationship: as the weight of the car increases, its MPG tends to decrease.\n",
    "* This confirms that 'weight' is a good feature to use for predicting 'mpg'.\n",
